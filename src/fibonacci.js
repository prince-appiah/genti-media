// A Fibonacci sequence is written as
// 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, â€¦.
// The Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence where the first two terms are 0 and 1.
// After that, the next term is defined as the sum of the previous two terms.
// How would you get the nth Fibonacci number?
// Example: fibonacci(12) should output 144
